            he Boston Celtics (ˈsɛlˌtɪks) are an American professional
            basketball franchise based in Boston, Massachusetts. They play in
            the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National
            Basketball Association (NBA). Founded in 1946 and one of eight NBA
            teams (out of 23 total teams) to survive the league's first decade,
            the team is currently owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC. The
            Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden, which they share
            with the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins. The franchise's
            seventeen championships are the most for any NBA franchise, and
            account for 25.4% of all NBA championships since the league's
            founding in 1946. This makes the Boston Celtics the most successful
            franchise to date in the major four traditional North American
            professional sports.\r\n\r\nThe Celtics have met the Lakers a record
            twelve times in the Finals, including their most recent appearances
            in 2008 and 2010, with the Celtics winning nine and Lakers winning
            three. Four Celtics (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry
            Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for an NBA record
            total of ten MVP awards. Their mascot 'Lucky the Leprechaun' is a
            nod to the team's Irish heritage and to Boston's historically large
            Irish population.\r\n\r\nThe Celtics rose again after struggling
            through the 1990s to win a championship in 2008 with the help of
            Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen. During this time, point
            guard Rajon Rondo developed into a perennial all-star. Paul Pierce
            and Kevin Garnett were later traded to the Brooklyn Nets.
